1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
India, so I don't really know.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,760
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,760
Alright.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,400
Drive with him?

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,720
Yeah.

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,880
Yeah.

7
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,200
Okay.

8
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,160
But same same price?

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,880
Pay this.

10
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,720
But I pay him.

11
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,120
Okay.

12
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,680
Done your batch.

13
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:16,735
Okay.

14
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,735
So I'm not sure how this works here now.

15
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:22,655
Maybe he is like a like a guy, like, contributing to passengers.

16
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,495
And then or maybe he's collecting the commission later from him.

17
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:26,975
I'm not sure.

18
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,930
If you know how this works here, please feel free to share your knowledge in the comments.

19
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,010
I'm always curious to learn about these things.

20
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,010
So as you can see, the traffic today, at least on this part of the town, is not that bad.

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,185
In case you're wondering what time it is, it is early afternoon now.

22
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:49,745
So I think that this part of Delhi Metro Area is not as busy as the Delhi Center.

23
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:55,525
So Gurgaon, the town where we're going now, it's basically a satellite city of Delhi.

24
00:00:55,525 --> 00:01:00,805
So I think if you drive from Delhi City Center to this town, should be in total around
